Roadmap: The Path to Agent Mastery

Imagine this like climbing a spiraling tower — each floor unlocks a new artifact.

🎯 Phase 1 — Foundations (5–7 days)

Understand the moving pieces.

Learn:

How LLMs do function calling

How tools work (JSON schema inputs → function → model uses output)

What a RAG system is (chunks → vectors → embedding search → context injection)

How streaming works (SSE / fetch with ReadableStream)

Build:

A simple “Chat with function calling” demo

A single tool (e.g., a calculator)

Goal artifact:
Your first “tiny agent” that calls a function during the chat.

🛠️ Phase 2 — Tooling Mastery (7–10 days)

Teach your agent to touch the world.

Learn:

How to define JSON schema tools

Async tools and streaming tool output

Passing tool output back into the model

Safety: controlling what tools can do

Build:

3–5 tools:

Web search (ScraperAPI or your own crawler 🤝 your GCP setup)

Database writer

File reader

Email sender

Weather API

Goal artifact:
Your “Agent Toolbelt” — a folder of reusable tool functions.

📚 Phase 3 — RAG & Knowledgebases (10–14 days)

Time to construct your library of Alexandria.

Learn:

Embeddings

Chunking strategies

Query rewriting

Retrieval augmentation

Hybrid search

Build:

Upload documents (PDF/MD/TXT)

Parse them

Chunk + embed

Store in Supabase

Retrieve for agent conversations

Goal artifact:
Your RAG pipeline with an admin dashboard.

🕸️ Phase 4 — Agent Types (7–12 days)

Agents are not just chatbots — they’re personalities with jobs.

Learn:

Architectures:

Reactive agents

Planning agents

ReAct

Toolformer-style

Autonomy loops

Multi-agent collaboration

Build:

Researcher agent (search → browse → summarize)

Planner agent (break goals into steps)

Orchestrator agent (dispatch tasks to other agents)

Goal artifact:
A mini “Agent Zoo” — 3 agents working together.

🔧 Phase 5 — MCP (Model Context Protocol) (7–10 days)

The future of tools. Add it to your OS.

Learn:

What MCP is

How to create an MCP server (Node)

How to expose filesystem, browser, databases, crawlers as MCP tools

Connect your agents to MCP tools

Build:

Your first MCP tool (e.g., read/write files)

Add MCP plugins into Aegis OS

Goal artifact:
An MCP-enabled agent that uses OS-level tools.

🔮 Phase 6 — Streaming Everything (5–7 days)

Make responses feel alive.

Learn:

Streaming model output

Streaming tool calls

Streaming tool results back to the client

Render real-time UI tokens in Next.js

Build:

Chat UI with token-by-token display

Live tool logs (like ChatGPT)

Partial thoughts & deltas

Goal artifact:
A ChatGPT-level realtime interface.

🏛️ Phase 7 — Aegis OS (Final Project)

All roads converge. Assemble the puzzle.

Build the full platform:

Dashboard

Create agent

Add tools

Add RAG knowledgebase

See tool logs live

Connect MCP tools

Set agent personality

Evaluate agent messages

Deploy

You now know:

✔ Agents
✔ Tools
✔ RAG
✔ Knowledgebases
✔ Streaming
✔ MCP
✔ Multi-agent systems
✔ Full stack glue
✔ Deployment
✔ Authentication
✔ tRPC + Next.js + Node

You’ve built an entire AI agent operating system.
