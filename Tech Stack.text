🌟 1. Best Tech Stack for Your Goals

Since you’re already fluent in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Express, Node, you’re basically holding Excalibur — you just need the runes carved on it.

Frontend (AI agent UI + streaming):

Next.js 15 (Server Actions, Edge runtime, Streaming responses)

React 19

Vercel AI SDK (for streaming tokens & tool calls elegantly)

tRPC or OpenAPI (for typed backend communication)

Tailwind for UI

Backend (Agents, Tools, RAG, MCP):

Node.js (TypeScript)

Express or Fastify (Fastify recommended for the agent backend—cleaner, faster)

OpenAI SDK (New v2) — supports:

JSON schema tools

Function calling

Responses with tool result streaming

LangChain (optional, but great for RAG + vector DB glue)

PostgreSQL + pgvector OR Pinecone for long-term knowledge

MCP framework (Model Context Protocol) from OpenAI

WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live tool/agent streams

Storage + RAG

Supabase or Qdrant

Embeddings model: text-embedding-3-large

Chunking library: langchain-text-splitter

Deployment

Frontend: Vercel

Backend: Render / Railway / Fly.io

Agents (real-time): Cloudflare Workers or Node server
